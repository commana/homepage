My minimal and destraction-free Linux development environment based on Lubuntu.

I always admired people that are super productive with their Linux environments. I've forever been a Windows and Mac user, with me occasionally trying out Linux, only to come back to my default OS because I grew frustrated with some aspect of Linux.

Would have been possible to start with an even smaller variant of Ubuntu, such as Ubuntu Server. However, my plan is to document and script as much as possible and then reinstall the system using Ubuntu Server. This will let me get rid of most of the bloatware that comes with Ubuntu's Dekstop versions. In addition, I was relucatnt to fiddle with X11. Lubuntu serves as an easy starting point as it comes with a working window manager.

Tools I use so far:

- Lubuntu 20.04
- i3 tiling window manager
- todo.sh for simple todo management
- Firefox browser
- A bare version of vim

Monitors

(Add picture of my three monitors.)

- /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/42-monitor.conf
- Increase font size due to 4K monitor: /home/commana/.Xresources

Managing Todos

- todo.sh as base w/ bash completion and alias
