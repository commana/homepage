> I write an average of five new programs every week. Poets have to write poems. I have to write computer programs.
- Donald Knuth

Why not leetcode etc? I feel like these aren't real programs. To me, a program should be something like a small linux app that follows the linux philosophy "do just one thing, and do it well." [??]

Inspirations to create programs

1. Use FTL-SDK to send a video to mixer.com

Size: Small

Not really a program, but rather infrastructure (docker).

2. PUBG-API CLI

Size: Small

A program that displays stats from the PUBG-API.

3. PUBG Console Player Queue

Size: Small

Display how many games have been finished in the last 15 minutes to understand how probable it is that another game could start soon.

4. An imager viewer with cmd support

Size: Big

An idea I had previously about a minimal image viewer that supports manipulation through a lisp-like language. I recently came across the Ronin project which is quite similar to my idea. Something worth stealing.

5. My own blogging editor

Size: Big

I currently use VSCode to write my blog. But it's obviously a bit too overpowered for simple blogging. A funny idea would therefore be to write a simple Markdown-based editor that supports my blogging workflow.

6. My own programming language

Size: Huge

Why not? It's been a long time since I have developed a language. Time to start something new and have fun.

7. Write Unit Tests for a random OSS project
