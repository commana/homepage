> I write an average of five new programs every week. Poets have to write poems. I have to write computer programs.
- Donald Knuth

Why not leetcode etc? I feel like these aren't real programs. To me, a program should be something like a small linux app that follows the linux philosophy "do just one thing, and do it well." [??]

Inspirations to create programs

1. Use FTL-SDK to send a video to mixer.com

Not really a program, but rather infrastructure (docker).

2. PUBG-API CLI

A program that displays stats from the PUBG-API.
