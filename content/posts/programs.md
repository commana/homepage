> I write an average of five new programs every week. Poets have to write poems. I have to write computer programs.
- Donald Knuth

Why not leetcode etc? I feel like these aren't real programs. To me, a program should be something like a small linux app that follows the linux philosophy "do just one thing, and do it well." [??]

Inspirations to create programs

1. Use FTL-SDK to send a video to mixer.com

Size: Small

Not really a program, but rather infrastructure (docker).

2. PUBG-API CLI

Size: Small

A program that displays stats from the PUBG-API.

3. PUBG Console Player Queue

Size: Small

Display how many games have been finished in the last 15 minutes to understand how probable it is that another game could start soon.

4. PUBG: It's a bot or not

Size: Large

Show how many Bots were in a particular game, and also tell players how many of their kills were bots. Did a player win a "whole chicken", ie. no bots in the game?
