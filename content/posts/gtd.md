My general setup

- MacBook, iPhone, PC with three OSes (Windows, Ubuntu, my minimal linux)
- Proper syncing is key
- Why did I end up using box.com?

Todo.txt for inbox and next actions

A paper journal and a journal.md

General-reference folders (online)

- still don't have proper offline folder system


To be continued.
