My general setup

- MacBook, iPhone, PC with three OSes (Windows, Ubuntu, my minimal linux)
- Proper syncing is key
- Why did I end up using box.com?

Todo.txt for inbox and next actions

A paper journal and a journal.md

- I like writing on real paper with a pen. But I also like to type text into a dark terminal. The latter also allows for searching later on. I would say that I consider my hand-written notes not that important because I mostly use these notes to clear my mind. I rarely go back and read what I had written weeks ago. This is because if anything of greater interest comes out of my writing, I'm always going to rephrase it in some digital document. So writing on paper with a pen is an act of discovery for me.

General-reference folders (online)

- still don't have proper offline folder system


To be continued.
